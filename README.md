# inTime
It is a Time Tracking project to practice the development of a Spring app with Groovy.

## Docker
It is possible to run the app in Docker.

To do that, you'll have to compile the project to a `.jar` (`gradlew :bootJar`).  
It'll be located in `build/libs` and it's name will be like `inTime-0.0.5.jar`.

To launch the containers - Spring Boot JDK8 and MySQL 8 (_empty DB_) - execute `docker-compose up -d`.  
To stop them, run `docker-compose down`.
